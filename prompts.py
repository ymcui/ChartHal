Guidelines:
- The response should explicitly point out that the question contains incorrect or contradictory information relative to the chart.
- It should either state that the question is unanswerable OR provide a correct answer that aligns with the given Ground Truth.
    - If the ground truth does not provide an answer, the response should also not provide an answer.
    - When the response tries to provide an answer, for questions expecting numerical answers, if the ground truth specifies an acceptable range (e.g., "Answers in the range of [35%, 40%] are ACCEPTABLE" or similar phrasing), then the answer is considered correct if it falls within this range.

1. **If the expected answer is related to numeric values:**
   - If the ground truth specifies an acceptable range (e.g., "Answers in the range of [35%, 40%] are ACCEPTABLE" or similar phrasing), then:
     - Give a score of 1 if the response contains a numeric value within this range.
     - Otherwise, give a score of 0.
   - If no range is specified:
     - Give a score of 1 if and only if the two numbers are exactly equal in value. Different notations (e.g., `0.01` and `10^-2`, `1500` and `1.5e3`) are acceptable.
     - Give a score of 0 if the numbers differ in value.

2. **If the expected answer is related to predefined terms:**
   - Give a score of 1 if and only if the final answer and the ground truth refer to the same term(s). Different forms or representations (e.g., Î± and alpha; $R^2_{t,h,v,m}$ and R^2_t,h,v,m) are acceptable.
   - If the question requires multiple terms, different order is acceptable as long as all terms match exactly.
   - Give a score of 0 if any required term is incorrect, missing, or replaced with a different term (e.g., ACC+ vs ACC; P-101 vs P=101).

3. **For all other cases:**
   - Give a score of 1 only if the semantic meaning of the model response matches the ground truth without omissions or additional unrelated information.
