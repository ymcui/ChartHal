Given this apparent inverse relationship, what underlying process or feedback mechanism might be causing phi to diminish so consistently with rising output, and how could engineers adjust system parameters to counteract this negative trend?",
        "ref_answer": "The premise of a steady negative correlation between phi and output is actually incorrect. The plot does not display a continuous decline of phi with increasing output but instead two distinct clusters of phi values (one near 0.2–0.3 and another near 0.6–0.7) that show no monotonic decrease. Because the assumed inverse relationship does not exist in the data, any analysis or proposed mechanism based on that false trend would be misleading."
